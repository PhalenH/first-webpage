        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p style="width:70%">
            Khruangbin is an American musical trio from Houston, Texas. The trio formed in 2010 and began recording sessions in a barn
            located in the small town of Burton, Texas. This became the home for all future recording sessions for the band. The name 
            "Khruangbin" originates from the Thai word for "aeroplane", which they have noted symbolizes the internation set of influences
            that shapes the band's formation. They have released three studio albums, with the latest being titled "Mordechai" and released
            in June of 2020. In 2021 they will be at various music festivals including "Outside Lands" in San Francisco this Halloween.
